UB_Clash_PAT
My Delphi PAT for Clash

We're doing Delphi in school.
This PAT is merely a way to test my skills in:
validation, text files, arrays, SQL ADO table queries with Microsoft Access through a small project called CLASH.
It's a very minuscule and basic remake of the Clash tournament in one of the games I play called League of Legends.

It works by taking you through a register and sign-in process where you register by using a Username and password rather than your League of Legends account.
The whole idea is to store all these users and their relevant information like rank and level. This information is used later on to place you among other competitors.
Here, any user can filter through all the other competitors in the database. You can see others' rank, level, games won, games played, and more.
You can also filter these results with lots of presets that fit your preference.
